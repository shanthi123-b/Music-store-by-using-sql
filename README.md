# Music-store-by-using-sql
The Music Store SQL project manages customers, artists, albums, songs, and orders with a normalized structure to avoid redundancy. It tracks sales, order history, pricing, and revenue while enabling searches by genre or artist. Scalable design allows reports and future features like playlists or subscriptions.
